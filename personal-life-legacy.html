            <p>During his life, MLK co-founded organisations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference that continue to advocate for civil rights and social justice. His movements also caused significant changes to legislation that strengthened equality and pushed America, alongside the rest of the world, on a path towards a fairer and more just society. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. 
            <br>His legacy of nonviolence and his message of love, equality, and justice continue to resonate, inspiring generations to seek positive change. In 1986 Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established on the third Monday of January as a federal holiday in the United States, commemorating his contributions to civil rights and social progress. His life and legacy have also been celebrated through art, music, literature, and film, capturing his impact on American history and culture. Various institutions, museums, and centers dedicated to civil rights education and commemoration honour MLK’s legacy and work.
