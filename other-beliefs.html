            <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was influenced by various philosophical and ethical ideas, particularly principles of nonviolence. He drew inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolent resistance and social change. MLK was best known for how he advocated for this nonviolent resistance as a powerful tool for social change, and as an effective way of challenging oppression and systemic racism. Many of his teachings emphasised the concept of an equal love for all people. He spoke about loving one’s enemies and opponents, emphasising the transformational power of love and compassion.

                According to MLK, responding to hate with hate only perpetuates a destructive cycle, and it was this mindset that drove his teachings about agape love. His nonviolent principles were put into practice during various civil rights campaigns, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott. These campaigns demonstrated how MLK’s teachings were true, and how loving one’s enemies could inspire change and advance civil rights.</p>
