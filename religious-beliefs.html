                <p>Martin Luther King’s early association with the Baptist Church through his family deeply rooted him in Christian faith. Apart from his grandfather on his father’s side, his family was moderately religious and frequently attended church (Family history of Martin Luther King, Jr., 2018). Attending church and being brought up in a Christian family instilled values like compassion, empathy, and equality into MLK at a young age. As a result of this, he felt a duty to ensure the church’s integrity, aiming to align it with his core Christian teachings. He strongly believed the church should be a force for positive societal change, which was far from what he observed.

                        “Papa was not religious, and although I don’t think he was very enthusiastic about my attending so many church affairs, he never interfered with Mama’s taking me”

                    His belief in the power of love and nonviolence was central to his faith, and as a result, MLK saw nonviolent resistance as an expression of Christ’s teachings (Martin Luther King Jr.'s Dream, 2019). 
                    His religious beliefs provided the foundation for challenging injustice and leading the civil rights movement.

                        "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, &ldquo;Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,&rdquo; but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."
                        <br>-James 2:14-17

                    In Christianity, faith is not only about believing, but acting upon one’s beliefs. MLK showed this concept of acting upon his beliefs to strongly represent his faith through his selfless acts of justice.
