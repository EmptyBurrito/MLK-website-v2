                <p>Martin Luther King&rsquo;s early association with the Baptist Church through his family deeply rooted him in Christian faith. Apart from his grandfather on his father&rsquo;s side, his family was moderately religious and frequently attended church. Attending church and being brought up in a Christian family instilled values like compassion, empathy, and equality into MLK at a young age. As a result of this, he felt a duty to ensure the church&rsquo;s integrity, aiming to align it with his core Christian teachings. He strongly believed the church should be a force for positive societal change, which was far from what he observed.

                        “Papa was not religious, and although I don’t think he was very enthusiastic about my attending so many church affairs, he never interfered with Mama’s taking me”

                    His belief in the power of love and nonviolence was central to his faith, and as a result, MLK saw nonviolent resistance as an expression of Christ&rsquo;s teachings. 
                    His religious beliefs provided the foundation for challenging injustice and leading the civil rights movement.</p>
