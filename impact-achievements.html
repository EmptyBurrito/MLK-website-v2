            <p>Throughout and after his life, Martin Luther King Jr. had a significant impact on the American civil rights movement. His charismatic leadership and skills inspired millions of individuals to demand racial equality and justice. An example of this was his pivotal role in organising the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955-1956 in response to racial segregation on buses. This successful boycott marked a significant early victory for the civil rights movement and helped launch MLK to national prominence. 
                His iconic “I Have a Dream” speech during the March on Washington became a symbol of his vision for racial equality. The march drew a massive crowd and increased pressure for comprehensive civil rights legislation.

                MLK’s commitment to nonviolence earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, making him the youngest recipient at the time. The prize highlighted his global impact and recognition as a leader for social justice. 
                Eventually, he expanded his focus beyond just racial segregation, addressing economic inequality and poverty. His Chicago campaign aimed to confront housing discrimination, while the Poor People’s Campaign sought to address broader issues of poverty and economic injustice.
